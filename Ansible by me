Command to install ansible
initially we need to install epel software(which must be enabled)
yum install epel -release
then
yum update -y
then we need to enable epel by the below command
sudo yum-config-manager --enable epel

there are some depencency packages used to install or run ansible
command for that is 
yum install git python python-devel python-pip openssl ansible
----------------------------------------------------------------
after installing we have to go to etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
In that we have to enable the inventory and sudo su for accessing purpose
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
then we have to create same user name and password in controller and cliend machines
ex:
useradd Mani
passwd Mani

Then we have to give all permisions to user (in Slave)
visudo
in that under
Username ALL=(ALL) nopasswd : ALL

then we have to move vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
and enable the 
PasswordAuthentication Yes

(we have to perform this operation in client server also
)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
user ccount name can be modified by goto "/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg"
	Then go to sudo_user = (User name)
	then save
	
	
fetch module is used to get the information from master node to slave node

-Name = dragging
 hosts = name or group
 become = yes
 taske:
   name: Fetching the date
   -fetch:
      src = src_path
	  dest = des_path

================================================================================

setting group name
vi etc/ansible/hosts
from home directory
add group name
[groupname 1]
ip address1 or host name
ip address2 or host name

[groupname 2]
ip address1 or host name
ip address2 or host name

steps to configure password login:

Firstly we have to take controller machie and node machines
then we have to generate in controler machine
ssh -keygen
these keys saved in /home/.ssh/
---------------------
then we have to paste this key to node machines
ssh-copy-id ec2-user@(public id of node machine)

Ansible Commands:

ansible -m ping (servername)

Command to check all the connections

ansible -m ping all

ansible -b -m "cat /var/www/html/index.html"
-b represents the command should be run by sudo or root user
-a represents the command which is under double quotes
command to run a program in a specific server
ansible -m ssh -a "yum install httpd" (node)

or

ansible -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" (node)

If we want to access or call custom inventory we have to user below commands to check

ansible all -i IPADDRESS, -m ping (For ipaddress based)
ansible all -i /opt/hosts -m ping(For path based)
i represents custon inventory

If we want to check the slave machine reachable or not we have to use "wait" module

ansible -m all setup | setup
Which is a command used to check teh servers details

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Play boook:

agent based chef(cookbook) and puppet):which has to install agent in both controller and guest machines and it is a pull based approach)
agent less:we dont need to install any softwares to guest machines and it is a push based approach

-a =arbitary 
-b =become
-------------------------------------------------------
Ansible

Ansible is a configuration management tool:
which uses playbooks 
playbooks uses yaml language
its a agent less configuration management tool

connecting controllernmachine to server:


ansible webserver -b -a "cat /var/log/messages
-b uses for sudo permissions
-i dynamic inventory
-m module
 docs.ansible.com >> which uses to help in ansible commands
 
 ansible ec2-user -b copy -a "src=parameter1 dest=parametr2"
 before applying this command we have to touch the file which we have to copy
 
 to install th software
 ansible common -b yum -a "name=elinks state=t  "
 
 
 ubuntu:
 -apt
 -apache2
 
 centos:
 -y-um
 -httpd
 
 getting the system information:
 ansible webserver -m setup
 
 hosts location should be in 
 vi etc/ansible/hosts
 
 we need to provide the groupd name in [ ](square brackets and under this we have to provide the private ip addresses of servers which we have to hosts
 
 command used to check the host systems are working or not
 ansible -m ping "name of the group"
 
 
 yaml:yet another markup languaguage
 Playbook is used to give the instruction (such as installing deploying code like that) from the controller system by ansible
 
 playbook contains:
 name:Name of the function to be performed
 hosts:name of the group or private ips of required systems
 become:Yes
 
 vars:
 type of software to be installed or code to be deployed
 
 tasks:
 -name:Name of the software
 yum:<Code to isnstall the tool>

Playbooks Concept:
we can use yaml and j son languages to decode the playbooks

-playbooks are used to define the sequence of the tasks(not only one task) to be executed on a group of hosts
-contains variables,tasks.handlers,files,templates and roles
started with "---"	
Terms containing Playbooks:
Declaration:
	
	-hosts:Target group
	-become:yes(which is applicable to sudo permissions)

var:
	pkgName:tomcat

Tasks:
-module(yum)
	parameters(examples given below)
	 name:httpd or {{pkgName}} for tomcat
	 state:latest
-copy:
	src:webapps.war
	dest:TOMCAT_HOME/webapps
	notify:tomcat(which is used to restart the tomcat server)
	
	handler: (It is used to perform the required function as mentioned in notify command)
	
		-service
		-name:tomcat
		-state:restarted
		-enable:yes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(30-04-2020)
command to run the playbook in target group
ansible-playbook "playbook name"
this command should be run from the controller system

if we dont know about the OS of the target group machines
we have to write the if command in playbooks
ex:
tasks:
	-name:if OS is redhat installation
yum:
	name:httpd
	state:present
	when:ansible_os_family='Redhat" 
	
lineinfile performing the operation in a specific line

ex:
lineinfile:
path: etc/surender
state:absent
regex:Mani

which absents the lines that contains Mani in the given path files

ex2:
vr = appserver

lineinfile:
path: etc/centos.conf
state:present
regex:Hosename:{{appserver}}

debug:
which is another type of method to perform functions
which represents the custom messages when the required file is not there
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[1-05-2020]
we must have to write indentation for every playbook(---space)
otherwise we will get syntax error
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple tasks on multiple servers in a single play book:
Yes,we can define it it single playbook
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Iterations:
if we want to do same task more than 20 to 30times,we can install/check then in single time
we will use with_items 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we can user 1 playbook for multiple environments or goups and multiple tasks
fot this operation we have to set the ansible roles 
ansible roles are used to reduce the time for repetetive process(just like of we want to do service related  operations, we dont neeed to write service related commands every time we have to write it in roles file and place it under roles section)
we have to creae different directories for each and every operation file
like in vars directory we have to create .yml file
in handler diectory we have to create .yml file
in that folder we have to addresses
	-tasks
	-files
	-vars
	-handlers
	-templates
now in playbook we have to add those operation programs
ex:(pattern)
	host:
	become:
	roles:
		(we ahve too paste the folders located in /eyc/ansible/roles/)
		-folder1(tasks file ):
		-folder2(handlers file):
		-folder3(servicesfile):
		-folder4(templates file):.
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
readymade roles available in internet 
	-Ansible galaxy(galaxy.ansible.com)
	search the role what you want
	select the role
	copy the path in that webpage
	paste it in your controller machine to download
	Command to install the role
	"ansible-galaxy rolename"
	ans the role will be installed in /etc/ansble/roles directory
	the we have to create the playbook and we have to paste the role folder name in the playbook and run it 
	
	ex:
	/etc/ansible $vi main.yml	---
	-Name:Installation
	 host:webserver
	 become:yes
	 become_user:root
	 roles:
		 -(rolename which we have  installed)
Save the file

Command to check the syntax
$ansible-playbook main.yml --syntax-check

Command to run the playbook:
$ansible-playbook mainyml
	
or 

$ansible-playbook main.yml (groupname)	
	
	
	then roles will add in playbook
default directory for ansible roles is home/.ansible/roles/
(we have to save the roles directory in  the above location)
forexample if we want to installtomcat 
we have to add the operation files(.yml format) in tomcat named directory
and we have to add that folder name under roles section in playbook
then we have t run the playbook in controller machine's ansible/roles directory

Steps to create ansible galaxy roles
 initially we have to be in /etc/ansible/roles/
 then we have to create a directory which conatins empty role directories with the below command 
 ansible-galaxy init directory name
 Ex: ansible-galaxy init sampleroles
automatically that folder contains some files
(Command is used to get the directory structure fpor roles)

defaults:Contains default variables that are going to be used by the role 
files:
handlers:
Meta:
tasks:
templates:
vars:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we are



Playbook mainly contains 
Hosts:
variables
tasks:
Handlers:


Ex:
---
-hosts:webserver
 tasks:
	name:install apache2
	yum:
		name=apache2
		update_cahe=yes
		state=latest
 notify:
	-restart apache2
 handlers:
	-name:restart apache2
	-service:
			name=apache 
			state=restarted


 become: yes
 become_user: Mani
 tasks:
   name: installing httpd
   yum:
     name:httpd
     state: latest
   name: starting httpd
   systemctl:
       name: httpd
       service: started
	   
- name: httpd installation
  hots: mserver
  become: yes
  become_user: Mani
  tasks:
    name: installing httpd
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: latest
    name: starting httpd
      systemctl:
        name: httpd
        service: started
